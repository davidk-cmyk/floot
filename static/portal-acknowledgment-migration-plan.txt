# PORTAL-BASED ACKNOWLEDGMENT SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Overview
Migration from policy-level acknowledgment (manual per-user assignment) to portal-level acknowledgment (automatic based on portal membership and roles).

## Current System Problems
- Manual assignment: Admin must individually assign each policy to each user
- No batch operations
- Portals are just "views" - don't drive workflow
- Tedious for organizations with many users

## New System Benefits
- Automatic assignment based on portal membership
- Portals represent audiences (employees, managers, clients, etc.)
- Simple mental model: "This portal requires acknowledgment" → everyone with access must acknowledge all policies
- Leverages existing role and access control structures
