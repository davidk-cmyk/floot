PROBLEM: The Organization Variables page doesn't provide examples or guidance on what variables to create, making it unclear how this feature can simplify policy editing.

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. ADD A HELPFUL DESCRIPTION/GUIDE at the top of the page (below "Define dynamic variables to personalize policy templates and content."):

   **Add a prominent help section that says:**
   
   "💡 **How Variables Work**
   
   Create variables for information that appears frequently across your policies. When you update a variable here, it automatically updates everywhere it's used.
   
   **Common Examples:**
   - {{ceo_name}} - CEO or Managing Director name
   - {{company_address}} - Registered office address
   - {{dpo_email}} - Data Protection Officer contact
   - {{hr_contact}} - HR department email or phone
   - {{emergency_number}} - Emergency contact number
   - {{head_office_location}} - Main office location
   - {{company_registration}} - Company registration number
   
   Simply type these variables in your policies (using the / key in the editor), and they'll automatically populate with the values you set here."

2. IMPROVE THE "ADD CUSTOM VARIABLE" EXPERIENCE:
   - When user clicks "Add Custom Variable", show a form with:
     - Variable name field (with placeholder: e.g., "ceo_name, company_address")
     - Variable value field (with placeholder: "Enter the actual value")
     - Optional: Variable description field
   - Add helper text: "Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., ceo_name, not CEO Name)"

3. ADD EXAMPLE VARIABLES AS SUGGESTIONS:
   - Below the "Add Custom Variable" button, add a small section:
   - "Quick Start: Add common variables" with clickable suggestions:
     - "+ CEO Name"
     - "+ Company Address"  
     - "+ DPO Contact"
     - "+ HR Email"
   - Clicking these pre-fills the form with suggested variable names

4. SHOW USAGE COUNT (if possible):
   - When variables are created and used in policies, show "Used in X policies" next to each variable
   - This helps users understand which variables are actively in use

GOAL: Make it immediately clear what variables are, why they're useful, and provide concrete examples so users can quickly start using this feature to simplify policy editing.
